# OpenWiki

OpenWiki is a CLI that writes and maintains documentation for your codebase, built specifically for agents. It can also ingest local knowledge sources through built-in connectors and synthesize them into a local wiki.

## Install

```sh
npm install -g openwiki
```

## Quick Start

Initialize OpenWiki, configure your model and API key, then generate documentation

```sh
openwiki --init
```

Then to ensure your documentation stays up-to-date, add the GitHub action to your repository to automatically open a PR once a day with documentation updates: [openwiki-update.yml](./examples/openwiki-update.yml)

Copy the contents of that file into `.github/workflows/openwiki-update.yml` in your repository.

## Usage

Start the interactive CLI:

```sh
openwiki
```

Start OpenWiki with an initial request:

```sh
openwiki "Please generate documentation for this repository"
```

Run a single command and exit:

```sh
openwiki -p "Summarize what you can do"
```

Initialize OpenWiki:

```sh
openwiki --init
```

Update existing documentation:

```sh
openwiki --update
```

Run an update that can ingest configured local connectors first:

```sh
openwiki --update "Refresh the wiki from configured connectors"
```

Show help:

```sh
openwiki --help
```

In chat, use `/api-key` to update the current provider API key and
`/langsmith-key` to update or clear LangSmith tracing credentials. Both commands
use masked prompts.

Authenticate a connector provider:

```sh
openwiki auth slack
openwiki auth gmail
openwiki auth x
openwiki auth notion
```

Start an ngrok tunnel for Slack OAuth:

```sh
openwiki ngrok start https://<your-ngrok-domain>
```

`openwiki` creates initial documentation in `openwiki/` when no wiki exists. If `openwiki/` already exists, it refreshes that documentation from repository changes. By default, the CLI stays open after each run so you can send follow-up messages. Use `-p` or `--print` for a one-shot non-interactive run that prints the final assistant output.

`openwiki` will automatically append prompting to your `AGENTS.md` and/or `CLAUDE.md` files to instruct your coding agent to reference it when searching for context. If the file does not already exist in your repository, OpenWiki will create it for you.

On the first interactive run, OpenWiki will have you configure your inference provider, API key, and LLM. You will also be able to set a LangSmith API key to trace your OpenWiki runs to a LangSmith tracing project named "openwiki" (optional).

These configuration options and secrets will be saved to `~/.openwiki/.env` on your local machine.

## Local Connectors

OpenWiki includes built-in connector scaffolding for local Git repositories, Notion, X/Twitter, Google, and Slack. During an `--update` run, the agent can call deterministic connector tools that write raw data and manifests under `~/.openwiki/connectors/<connector>/raw/`, then synthesize the wiki from those local files.

- `git-repo` reads configured local repository paths and writes compact manifests.
- `x` uses the X API directly with OAuth user-context credentials for home timeline, user posts, mentions, bookmarks, and list posts.
- `notion` targets the hosted Notion MCP server, so users should authenticate through Notion OAuth instead of pasting a Notion token into OpenWiki.
- `google` is Gmail-first for now, with room to add Drive, Calendar, and other Google providers later.
- `slack` uses the Slack API directly with OAuth user-token credentials for self-message search, recent conversation history, DMs, and private channels visible to the user.

Connector secrets are referenced by env var name and stored in `~/.openwiki/.env`; connector config files should never contain raw secret values.

`openwiki auth <provider>` runs a local browser OAuth flow, saves returned tokens into `~/.openwiki/.env`, creates connector config when possible, and discovers MCP tools for MCP-backed providers. Slack and Gmail require app client credentials to already be set in that file; Notion uses dynamic client registration for hosted MCP; X uses OAuth 2.0 with PKCE.

`openwiki auth configure <provider>` and `openwiki auth tools <provider>` are advanced/retry commands for regenerating connector config or inspecting live MCP tools.

See `openwiki/operations/connector-auth.md` for provider setup steps, scopes, redirect URI caveats, and saved env vars.

## Customizing

OpenWiki supports OpenRouter, Fireworks, Baseten, OpenAI and Anthropic out of the box. By default, there are a few models pre-defined (GLM 5.2, Kimi K2.6, Sonnet 5, etc) but for each inference provider, OpenWiki will allow you to specify your own custom model ID.

If there's an inference provider or model you'd like to see added, please open a PR!
