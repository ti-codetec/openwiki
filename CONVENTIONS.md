# Contributing to OpenWiki

How code here is meant to look and where it's meant to live. It's short; read it
before your first PR.

Rules are tagged like `[ow:interface-over-type]` so a review comment or a lint
error can point you straight back to the reason. If a rule turns out to be
wrong, change it in the PR that proves it wrong and say why.

## Where code lives

OpenWiki is a CLI that runs an LLM agent to document a repo (`code` mode) or your
own notes (`personal` mode). The agent loop itself is the `deepagents` package;
our code is the shell around it. `openwiki/quickstart.md` has the bigger picture.

Each concern owns a directory:

| Directory          | Owns                                                                                |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `src/cli/`         | Arg parsing, dispatch, the subcommand and `--print` handlers. Keep it thin.         |
| `src/ui/`          | Ink (terminal React) components. No domain logic.                                   |
| `src/providers/`   | Provider registry, provider/model resolution, `createModel`, model-provider OAuth.  |
| `src/config/`      | `~/.openwiki/.env` persistence, credential logic, the secret registry, redaction.   |
| `src/agent/`       | Run orchestration, the prompt, the write-scoping backend, stream parsing, metadata. |
| `src/connectors/`  | The data-source connectors and their OAuth.                                         |
| `src/constants.ts` | Literals only. No logic.                                                            |

`[ow:one-concern-per-dir]` New code goes where its concern already lives. If
nothing fits, that's a conversation, not a reason to drop it in the nearest file.

One trap worth naming: there are two unrelated OAuth systems. Model-provider
login (to the LLM, in `src/providers/`) and connector login (to Gmail, Slack, and
friends, in `src/connectors/`). They share only the `.env` store. A change to one
is never a change to the other, so don't review it as though it were.

## TypeScript

`[ow:interface-over-type]` Object shapes are `interface`. Keep `type` for the
things an interface can't express: unions, intersections, tuples, mapped types.

```ts
// no
type RunContext = { gitSummary: string; wikiGoal?: string };

// yes
interface RunContext {
  gitSummary: string;
  wikiGoal?: string;
}

// type still earns its keep:
type OpenWikiProvider = "anthropic" | "openai" | "openrouter";
```

`[ow:undefined-over-null]` Absent is `undefined`, not `null`. Don't add `| null`.
If you're already editing code that uses it, flip it rather than run both
conventions side by side.

`[ow:no-any]` No `any`. Use `unknown` at the boundary and narrow it. If you truly
need `any`, leave a comment explaining why.

`[ow:readonly-inputs]` Mark properties and array params `readonly` when nothing
is meant to mutate them.

## Docstrings

`[ow:docstring-exports]` Every export gets a docstring, and `[ow:docstring-fields]`
so does every field of an interface, including obvious-looking ones; for
optional fields, say what happens when they're absent. Explain what the thing is
for, not what its name already says.

`[ow:docstring-style]` Always the block form, never a collapsed one-liner, with a
blank line between documented fields:

```ts
/**
 * A single labeled diagnostic line describing an error, for display or logs.
 */
export interface ErrorDiagnostic {
  /**
   * Short label naming the field (e.g. `status`, `header.cf-ray`).
   */
  readonly label: string;

  /**
   * The value, already redacted for display.
   */
  readonly value: string;
}
```

`[ow:comment-the-why]` Comments explain why, not what. If a line needs a comment
to say what it does, rewrite the line instead.

## Errors and secrets

`[ow:validate-early]` Check inputs where they enter and throw a plain `Error`.
Don't let a bad value travel deeper into the code.

`[ow:actionable-messages]` An error says what broke, the offending value where
it's safe to show, and how to fix it. No bare "failed", no apologies.

The rule that matters most here: forgetting something should fail safe, not leak.
Make the safe path the path you get for free.

`[ow:redact-user-output]` Anything that might carry a credential and reaches a
user or a log goes through `src/config/redaction.ts` first: error messages,
header dumps, provider response bodies.

`[ow:secret-registry]` Secrets are declared once, in the registry. Redaction and
diagnostics both derive their list from it, so registering a key in one place
makes it persisted, masked, and redacted everywhere. Never keep a second "these
are the secrets" list.

`[ow:secret-default-closed]` `[ow:no-fail-open]` A managed env key is secret
unless it's explicitly marked otherwise, so forgetting to classify one
over-redacts instead of leaking. Same idea everywhere: when correctness depends
on someone remembering to call a scrubber or pass a flag, restructure so the safe
thing happens by default.

## Structure and style

`[ow:no-god-files]` One file, one responsibility. Around 500 lines is where you
stop and split. The 3.8k-line `cli.tsx` is exactly what we're unwinding.

`[ow:ui-separate-from-logic]` Domain logic stays out of Ink components. If
something can only be tested by rendering a component, it's in the wrong place.

`[ow:constants-are-literals]` A constants file holds values. Resolution and
branching are logic and belong in a real module: `resolveConfiguredProvider`
lives in `src/providers/`, not `constants.ts`.

`[ow:kebab-files]` Filenames are kebab-case: `model-factory.ts`.

`[ow:style-is-automated]` Quotes, semicolons, import order, line length: Prettier
and ESLint own these, so run the formatter instead of arguing in review. (Lint
rules that enforce the conventions above are coming; until then they're review
conventions.)

## Testing

`[ow:test-the-boundary]` The security and correctness boundaries get tests for how
they fail, not just the happy path: redaction, the write-scoping backend,
provider/model resolution, env parsing.

## Adding a provider or a connector

**A provider.** First ask whether it speaks the OpenAI wire format. If it does,
it's already supported: point `OPENAI_COMPATIBLE_BASE_URL` at it and you're done,
no PR required. A first-class entry earns its place only with a curated model
list or a genuinely different wire format or auth. When one is warranted: add it
to the `OpenWikiProvider` union and the registry, add its key to the managed env
keys and mark it secret (redaction follows automatically), add a `createModel`
branch only if it isn't OpenAI-compatible, and test resolution.

**A connector.** Fetch raw data deterministically, let the agent synthesize it,
and keep those two steps apart. Connector auth is the connector OAuth system,
never the model-provider one. MCP-backed connectors are read-only.
